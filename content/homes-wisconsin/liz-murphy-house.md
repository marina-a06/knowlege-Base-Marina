Frank Lloyd Wright's Murphy House refers to the Elizabeth Murphy House, the last remaining completed American System-Built Home (ASBH), which served as a site for Wright's exploration of affordable housing and a pivotal point in his career after a conflict with assistant Russell Barr Williamson. The house, located in Milwaukee, was rediscovered in 2015 and has undergone significant restoration, becoming the subject of the book Frank Lloyd Wright's Forgotten House.
