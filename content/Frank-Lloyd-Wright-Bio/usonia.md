## Usonian Style
Frank Lloyd Wright would go on designing projects and end up being one of the most influential American Architects of the time.  We will discover that when discussing the end of his life's adventures and the [[frank-lloyd-wright-bio/legacy|legacy]] he left behind.

Following the Great Depression, in 1934, Frank Lloyd Wright began to design homes for the _middle class family_.

Some of the known characteristics of a Usonian home are:
* small, single story
* No garage and little storage
* L-shaped around a garden
* Flat long roofs with large overhangs

The first home design for a family was the Malcolm Willey House.
